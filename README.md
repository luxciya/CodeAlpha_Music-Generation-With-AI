# CodeAlpha_Music-Generation-With-AI
This project demonstrates how to generate music using deep learning. It uses MIDI files as input, processes them into note sequences, and trains a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to generate new music compositions. The generated music is saved as MIDI files.
